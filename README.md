<h1>Weather<h1>
 I've created a weather website that provides an aesthetic and user-friendly interface. Here are the key features of my project:
🎥 Visual Experience: My webpage stands out with an eye-catching video background and a modern design.
🌍 City-Based Weather: Users can easily track real-time weather information by entering the city name.
🌡️ Temperature Units: I offer users the option to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit units, providing a personalized experience.
🎨 Icon Usage: By incorporating Bootstrap and Font Awesome icons, I visually enhance the page and convey weather elements meaningfully.
📅 Date and Time Information: Users can check the currentness of weather information by viewing date and time details.
🛠️ Technologies: Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project features a modular structure that is easily extendable and maintainable.
